## Business Process Analysis
Business Process Analysis (BPA) involves analysing the current state of a business process to identify risks and improvements where operational efficiencies can be obtained. Our comprehensive understanding of the higher education sector allows us to thoroughly understand the intersection between professional and academic staff, including the workflows, bottlenecks, and governance structures, the complexity of multiple IT systems, including Learning Management Systems, Student Management Systems, and Academic Information Systems.  


Our deep knowledge of higher education and expertise in policy analysis and interpreting TEQSA, ASQA, and ESOS Standards allows us to identify not only efficiencies to be had, but the risks to compliance that discrepancies between policy and practice can produce. 


## Business Process Automation
Student surveys and other data reporting on student performance, academic integrity, and student success and retention, must be produced regularly to meet TEQSA and ASQA requirements. 
Often these processes are left to be manually prepared by the responsible team, whether or not they're experienced with data tools or analysis. This can create issues with data accuracy, 
the quality of the conclusions you're drawing, and create unsustainable workloads as the need for data to inform decisions increases exponentially.  


Business process analysis is the first step in identifying efficiencies and opportunities for automation. For some processes, you can reduce a single task from days or hours to minutes.
We work with teams to identify sustainable and no cost solutions to fast-track regular reporting and reduce frustration with manual tasks.
