## Copilot for Process Improvement Training
Our Copilot for Process Improvement Training empowers professionals in higher education to effectively integrate AI tools into their daily workflows. By focusing on real-world challenges such as policy interpretation, compliance reporting, and data-driven decision making, we provide training that is practical, sector-specific, and outcomes-oriented.

This training goes beyond learning how to prompt Copilotâ€”it develops advanced skills in:

- Using Copilot to analyse compliance risks in TEQSA, ASQA, and ESOS-related processes

- Streamlining reporting and documentation with structured AI assistance

- Identifying automation opportunities where Copilot can reduce workload complexity

- Building confidence in responsible AI use within regulated environments

By the end of the training, participants will have the confidence to integrate AI into critical processes and apply it responsibly in ways that enhance both precision and efficiency.

## Individual and Team Copilot Mentoring
To embed lasting impact, we also offer tailored mentoring for individuals and teams who wish to go deeper into practical adoption of AI tools. Mentoring provides ongoing, hands-on support that helps participants refine their skills and ensure Copilot is applied strategically in their context.

Through mentoring, we work with:

- Individuals, helping them adopt Copilot for their role-specific tasks such as policy analysis, compliance reporting, student engagement monitoring, or academic quality reviews

- Teams, enabling group-wide alignment on Copilot use, fostering collaboration, and ensuring that automation and reporting practices remain sustainable and scalable

Our mentoring approach ensures consistent skill-building, reduces reliance on trial-and-error learning, and supports teams in shaping a culture of responsible AI adoption while managing compliance risks.

Mentoring is customised for the needs of higher education professionals, from compliance staff to academic quality teams, ensuring that every individual gains tangible, immediately useful outcomes.
